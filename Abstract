# Why This Project:
- I chose to work on fraud detection because it is a real-world problem with significant impact,especially in sectors like banking, insurance, and e-commerce.

- Fraud not only leads to financial losses but also affects customer trust. 

- By exploring data-driven solutions, such as machine learning techniques, I can contribute to building systems that detect and prevent fraudulent activities more effectively. 

- This project provides a great opportunity to apply my skills in data analysis, pattern recognition, and 
machine learning to solve a problem that is both challenging and meaningful.


# Genaral overview.

- Fraud detection is an essential task in industries like finance, insurance, and online retail, 
  where fraudulent transactions can result in major financial losses.

- This project aims to identify patterns in transactional data that indicate fraud using machine learning techniques.

- By analyzing historical data and learning from known fraudulent cases,
  algorithms such as decision trees and support vector machines can be trained to detect unusual behavior in new data.

- The main challenge is dealing with highly imbalanced datasets,
   where fraud is rare compared to normal transactions.

-This study explores simple yet effective approaches to improve fraud detection accuracy and reduce false positives.
